Project Final

**Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?**
The client was The Gaming Room for this project. Their goal was to expand their Android game titled "Draw It or Lose It" to other platforms by having me create a web-based version.

**What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?**
I compared the most common operating systems which are macOS, Windows, and Linux. My research allowed me to uncover each platforms advantages and disadvantages in terms of requirements for the server side, client side, and available development tools. Ultimately, it made it easier to make recommendations to the client.

**What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?**
The design document is useful in that it helps others understand the what is required for the project. It also prevented me from going outside the scope of work and forced me to think through the entire architecture of the application. 

**If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?**
One part of the software documentation that I would revise is the "Design Constraints" section. I would improve this section by listing the constraints in bulleted points, making it faster and easier for others to understand. 

**How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?**
I was able to interpret the user's needs based on the domain model that was provided. It's important to consider the users needs to help us save time and them money. Understanding their needs also helps us understand who our users are and why they use a service or product, in this case, a game application.

**How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?**
I implemented design patterns in the software for the application. Using design patterns makes the code more flexible, reusable, and maintainable. I would consider using design patterns in future applications because they are ultimately reusable solutions to common software design problems.
